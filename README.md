Backbone-Filtering
==================

Extension to Backbone.Collection to enable a filter method which returns a Collection kept up to date with the original

Currently supports adding and removing items to the base collection and also filtered collections are updated when a model changes

Where there are mutally exclusive filters on a collection I'm hoping to add a 'move' event from one to the other  - *this is not in yet*
